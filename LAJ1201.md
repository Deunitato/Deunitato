Review:

Do not take this mod unless you are very good in Japanese. Most people who take this mod are people who pretend to have no knowledge of the language only to wreck the bell curve. Not recommended for new learners. Overall, I did have fun in the module but I was extremely dismayed by people who pretended to be a new learner only to destroy the bell curve.

Seriously, if you want to learn the language, learn it outside.

I have a friend who brags about knowing about Japanese and lying about having 0 experience in the language throughout the course of the module. I even overheard people proudly telling their friends

 " Just pretend you don't know Japanese then score A" during lectures.

Overall a fun yet bad experience. I don't even know why NUS offers language mods if they don't even set a fair setting for new learners
