This reading is so boring that I want to die.<br /><br />The first part of the reading is about the history of the writer, Richard. The whole thing is just him wanting us to appreiat3e what we have<br /><br /><h3>Uncertainty of science</h3><div><b>Nature of science and existence of doubt and uncertainty</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>Ideas are born every day and is developed in the history of man, ideas dont last unless they are pass purposely.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Science is sometimes means:</div><div>- Body of knwoledge beig found out</div><div>-Doing of new things you have just found out</div><div>- Special method of finding things out</div><div>- Actual doing of new things</div><div><br /></div><div>Science is partly technology</div><div><br /></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>News things we can do</b></div><div>- Science creates a lot of possibilities like industrial revolution</div><div>- Controlling sickness</div><div>- Scientific means of production</div><div><br /></div><div>Science is like a power, can be use for good or evil depending how we use it.&nbsp;</div><div>- Airplanes</div><div>- Airplanes for war</div><div><br /></div><div>Is science of any value?</div><div>- To do something has value, the power is value.</div><div>- Result is depending on how we use it</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Contents of science</b></div><div>The work is not done for the sake for application but for the excitement of what is found out.
