# Time complexity
- worse case and average:
 - Worse: Max time that is required with input size n
 - Avg: Assume that input is distributed somewhere randomly

> Assume the finite set of inputs, we consider only contains two inputs, A1 and A2. The time needed for solving them is T1 and T2.
Avg time is (T1+T2)/2
