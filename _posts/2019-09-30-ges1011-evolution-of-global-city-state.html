It was during a moonless night where two people was killed and one person was injured.</div><div>The man who owed money, ask to look for his debter, the debter had went to Farquahar for protection. What happen was that that man brought a knife, and slashed Farquahar who was injured.</div><div><br /></div><div>This caused alot of panic among the european such that everyone who heard about it as they are afraid of a malay uprising, they decide to deface his dead body. They thought it was the temmongon's men. Raffles arrived on the scene and the jailer confirmed that it was not a malay uprising.</div><div><br /></div><div>Raffles had the corpse carted around town and hung up for display for a fortnight in an iron cage up for display. The corpse was badly mutilated and he put it up for display.</div><div>This iron cage was made from the night of the event.</div><div>=&gt; Raffles knows it was not a malay uprising</div><div>=&gt; He knew it was a misunderstanding</div><div>=&gt; yet he hang them up for display</div><div>=&gt; Make a cage overnight</div><div><br /></div><div>The chinese and Europeans were afraid for a Malay uprising.</div><div>Yet, turnbull still uses "remarkably insensitive" to describe raffles despite his gory actions</div><div>- History is being whitewashed, this is due to a legacy of imperalism</div><div>We only look at his good points , free trade but we shall not overlook his bad points</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Hikayat:</b></div><div>Abdullah praises colonial figures and made alot of money</div><div><br /></div><div>"How would you characterise colonism/Imperiation?"</div><div><br /></div><div>- The elites benefited from colonialism and not just the&nbsp;</div><div>- The rich people,&nbsp; help colonise this country by working with the imperial powers to establish colonialism in this space</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Lester/Lambert</b></div><div>Stop thinking about imperialism as only trade/ money/power</div><div>The configuration of people and experience, things and practice in their own right</div><div><br /></div><div>Imperialism in singapore is probably a different experience than imperialism in other places.
