# Hypotheses testing base on normal distribution

## Null and alternative hypothesis
- A statistical hypothesis is an assertion on conjecture concerning one or more populations

- Consider 2 characteristics of a population
  - Ratio
  - Mean
  - Variance
- "do not reject" and reject 

### Statistical hypothesis
The rejection of a hypo is to conclude is false

Acceptance of Hypo implies that we have insufficient evidence to believe otherwise


Because of this terminology, the statsician will often choose to state the hypo in a form that hopefully will be rejected

### Null hypothesis
- Denoted by H0
- Fomulate in hope of rejecting
- Concern a population parameter will always be stated to specify an exact value of the parameter

### Alternative Hypothesis
- Denoted by H1
- More than one values
- Rejection H0 this leads to the acceptance of alternative hypothesis denoted by H1


*E.g 1*

- We want to determine if the mean of IQ of pupils in a certain sch is different from 100
- We have H0: u = 100 against H1: u != 100

This is call two side alt
