# Population and sample

> How does each sample's avg behaves?
That is the sampling distribution

- The totality of possible outcomes or observation of a surve or experiment is populate
- Sample is a subset of population
- Every outcome or observation can be recorded as a numerical or categorical value. Thus each member of a population is a value of a random variable.
