The video has some symbolism being shown towards the indian perception of gay couples. Since the video was publish 4 years before the removal of penal code 377 which stated that LGBT marriages were not allowed, I feel that the video was made to encourage acceptance of the LGBT community amongst the people especially the Indian Community.<br /><br />The video started with showing a Indian family preparing for what looks like a celebration. However, during the video, there was an elder overseeing the preparation who appears to stare at anyone whose behavior is disapproving to her eyes. This is shown when the young boy threw something at another lady, she stared at him with disapproving eyes leading to the young boy running away in guilt. The elder woman represents the traditional views the Indians especially the elders has on certain behaviors. When the man introduce his gay partner, the elder lady is seen staring at them. However, her stare changes into a smile after the main singer lead convinced her to accept change and the confrontation ended up with a exciting party with everyone dancing happily together.<br /><br />The video is trying to tell the audience that the traditional way of thinking is in the past and to make way for the new change. The video is also trying to emphasise on the fact that even though the couple is gay, as long as the two individuals care and love each other, there will be a happy ending as seen by the exciting party at the end.<br /><br />Since the UN posted the video, many people might be influenced by the message as to the people, the UN is considered as a reliable and credible source due to it's importance as a political organisation. However, despite it being a video global, the UN might be subtly aiming at the Indian community or more specifically aimed at India. India at the time had not remove the penal code which forbid gay marriages thus they are trying to convince the India people to be more open to the changes in society.<br /><br /><br /></div>
