Talk about the underlying assumption made by the suppose singer of the song<br /><br /><b>1.&nbsp; Comparison</b><br /><b>- He assume that he is not good enough.</b><br />- Described all good things about people<br />- "Clearly I don't see myself upon that list"<br />- Assume that he is not as good as those people in the list<br /><br /><u>Linked</u><br />- Perceived idols around us.<br />- Fame, money , power<br />- Advertisements<br />- See them everywhere<br />- Human nature to compare with them with ourselves<br /><br /><b>2. Risk</b><br /><b>- </b>"How much you want to risk"<br />- Risk changing yourself<br />- Change for the better?<br />- Lose ourselves when change<br /><br /><u>Linked</u><br />- change ourselves to be like the people we idolise<br /><br /><b>3. Where you want to go</b><br /><b>- </b>She already accepted him<br />- Assure him<br />- Tell him there's no need to change to be like them<br />- Be yourself<br />- There's no need to risk change when shes fine with just the way he is<br />- assures by saying that Iâ€™m not looking for somebody with superhuman gifts<br />- just someone who is there for her<br /><br />
