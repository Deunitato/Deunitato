# Sensor/Actuator interface with micro controller
- Sensor data has to be processed and transmitted
- Sensor connect to a microcontroller through establish interfaces

## Serial interface: UART
- Asyncronous: No clock
- Simple connection
- COmmon porotocl used for full duplex serial communcation
- Send one bit at a time
