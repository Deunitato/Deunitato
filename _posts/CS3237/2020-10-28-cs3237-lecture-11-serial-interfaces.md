# Sensor/Actuator interface with micro controller
- Sensor data has to be processed and transmitted
- Sensor connect to a microcontroller through establish interfaces

## Serial interface: UART
- Asyncronous: No clock
- Simple connection
- COmmon porotocl used for full duplex serial communcation
- Send one bit at a time

## Serial interface: SPI
- Synchronous
- One master and one slave
- Short distance communication (embedded system)
- Max clock rate: 12.5 MHZ
### Signals:
- Clock
- Chip select
- Master out, slave in
- Master in, slave out

- The device that gen the clock sig is master
- data trans mitted between master and slave is sych to the clock generated by the master

## Serial Interace:I2C
- Syncrhonous
- Follows the clk data
- Both master and slave can send data
- There are multiple slaves, address bits define which slave to communcate to
- Read write bit: Show if the master wants to request or send data
- All the slaves will look at the address and see ifits matches it address
	- Yes: Pulls the data line to low (This data line is shared to low but only one can pull)
    	- Master will then knows that the slave exist
        - Data is sent
        - This is followed by the ack lines that show that the data is send or recieved
- Ends when the SDA goes high after SCL

> Difference between SPI and I2C
> - SPI: Can keep sending data
> I2C: Based on data frame
