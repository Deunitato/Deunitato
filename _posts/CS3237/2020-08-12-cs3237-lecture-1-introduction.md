# Internet of things

Thing + Computer intelligence + connection to internet

## Architecture
- Embedded system (Things)
- Node devices (THings) collect data through sensors
- Data is sent to the internet through the gateway
- Data analytics takes place in cloud or data center

> These things may not have connection to the internet, thus it needs to connect to a computer system (Gateway) whcih are considered as edge (of internet)


## Understanding IOT Data
Important:
- Power management
- security
- Data conversion

Data:
- Too big
- Too fast: Data streaming and often processed in real-time	
- Too diverse: Different types of data types (Image data, heart rate data)


### Ways to understand data:
- Descriptive: "What happen", summarises/presents the raw IoT data
- Diagnostics: Look and understand the process that is causing the data (ML)
- Discovery: Find patterns that we did not notice earlier, explain those patterns (Event)

> Marketing found that epoeple in the eastern part of singapore prefer a particular brand of shampoo compared to those of the west. (Pattern)

- Predictive: Use data and answer the question of what is going happen next
- Prescriptive: Find a solution to the predictive analysis
