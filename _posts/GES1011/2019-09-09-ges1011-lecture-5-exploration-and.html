Recap:<br />The historical difference between turnbull and Miksic.<br />- Difference in opinions and theories<br />- Difference in time framing in when events happen<br /><br />"What happen between the 14th century and 1819"<br /><br />Singapura's nodal trading polity in 14th century is following the regional legacu of Funan and Srivijiya<br />But its not as dominant as those and only lasted a century<br /><br /><h3>Trade to religion</h3><div>The transition from buddhism to islam is detectable in the Sulalat.&nbsp;</div><div>-Emphasis on white&nbsp;</div><div>- Cosmology</div><div>- White elephants and white blood</div>- Names of rulers are buddhist at the beginning but there was a shift towards the end of singapore's 5 kings where the ruler's name, Sultan Iskandar Shah, is islamic in nature<br /><br />Certain figures are adopted like Alexander the Great that was dimmed to be the last ancestor of the last king.<br />A persian influenced Islamic name<br /><br />A reading, <b>Kwa's persian cosmopolis,</b>&nbsp;shows that Farsi was the language of trade along the silk roads of the land and sea.<br /><br /><h3>Singapura: A trading node</h3><div>Miksic discovery suggest that there is no significant activity around 14th century early</div><div>There was also a sharp decline at the end of the 14th century.</div><div>There was a 100 years of activity before it quiet down.</div><div>However, the Sulalat was not enough to show evidence but sulalat states that there is a siamese attacks and that the last ruler of singapura fled.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h4>Fate of Singapura's trading</h4><div>We can assume that there might be attacks on singapore due to rivals that were jealous of the blooming port of singapore. But Kwa Chong Guan said that the decline of singapore might have been cause by a mini ice age that lasted from early 14th century and peak towards 17th century.</div><div><br /></div><div>Scientist have detected that there was a tempurature change during these period and might have resulted in colder winters in the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But it might have not affected singapura too much but given the destabilising effect on china, suggest that china depopulated by 40%. This led to a decline for trade and thus affecting people who are in the trading economy like singapura.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is a speculation that since there was a decrease in trade, the traders might have move for a better place to trade. Siamese might have attack due to the decline of trade as well.</div><div><br /></div><div>Singapura demise might be due to a combination of events namely started with the weather as speculated by Kwa Chong Guan.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>However</b>, we don't really know how it happen exactly but we do know it happened. (All is speculated)</div><div><br /></div><h4>Like suvijaya</h4><div>- rivals</div><div>- Sea base trade</div><div><br /></div><div>Singapore's demise led to the emergence of melaka.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Under the control of a Laksamana</h3><div>Melaka came after singapore fell.&nbsp;</div><div>It was founded at the turn of 15th century and lasted about 100 years.</div><div>The name of the first ruler: Parameswara/ Iskandar Shah?</div><div>He was named differently in different sources.</div><div><br /></div><div>There was a mix of around 84 different languages.</div><div>Unlike other ancient empires, melaka was not suspicious toward foreigners and dread of polluting foreign contact.</div><div><i><u>"Cosmopolitan"</u></i></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>"Is 2019 Singapore Cosmopolitan?"</div><div><br /></div><div>Reason of success:</div><div>- Chinese protection</div><div>- Maritime protection</div><div>- Judicious regime that facilitated fair play in trade by enforcement of common code of moral law.</div><div>- The coherence of fairness and justice might be linked to islam</div><div><br /></div><h4>Trading policy</h4><div>Low Custom duties during Mansur Shah</div><div>Low level of charges base on sea vessel origin</div><div><br /></div><div>These are very low compared to rivals like Ayuthia, Bengal , Pegu.</div><div><br /></div><div>The ruler is sacrificing income (Paycut) which led him to be competitive in turns of duties.&nbsp;</div><div>This led to innovation and enlightenment period economic compared to europe. Melaka was quite modern.</div><div><br /></div><div>Melaka is led by a man of prowess and had an administration that was able to establish and manage a maritime trading center.</div><div><br /></div><div><u><i><span style="color: #274e13;">Laksamana -&gt; A military administration (Naval head?)</span></i></u></div><div><br /></div><div>Singapore has fallen under the control of Laksamana including other island south of the peninsula.</div><div><br /></div><h4>Melaka fall to portuguese&nbsp;</h4><div>24 August 1511</div><div><br /></div><h3>Early Europeans</h3><div>The western trade was mainly in the hands of persians, Indians.</div><div>The 15 Century saw a increase of the portuguese in the trading area.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is the European Age of Exploration</div><div><br /></div><div>Why do we think that the journey is consider the age of exploration when the exploration started with human migration.</div><div><br /></div><div>Portuguese wanted the spice trade so they started inventing a better sailing vessel.</div><div>Portuguese sack melaka.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Johor</h3><div>A maritime trading polity but not completely similiar with singapore and melaka.</div><div>Johor move around.</div><div><br /></div><div>The end of the singapura line due to a regicide in 1699.</div><div><br /></div><div>Rivals</div><div>- Portuguese</div><div>- Jambi</div><div>- Aceh</div><div>(Later)</div><div>- Duch/VOC</div><div><br /></div><div>Dutch allied with Johor against the portuguese and they manage to take back Melaka.</div><div>Dutch mediated the Johor-Aceh treaty in 1641 and Johor was establish as preeminent power.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, they were slowly taken over by the Dutch</div><div><br /></div><h3>An Island in a contested realm</h3><div>There is evidence that even thou there is no activity near the singapore river, there was activity at Kallang river. There is very limited archeological evidence due lack of protection of archaeological find.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is european archival evidence that both the Portuguese and Dutch had discussed plans to build fortifications on singapura to help assert dominance.</div><div><br /></div><div>The trade activity was pushed further southwards towards Jakarta due to the Dutch. The Dutch also effectively created the addition to the silk wards that were based on the main lands.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Singapore was not a sleepy fishing village immediately after its sharp decline at the end of the 14th century.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sleepish fishing village"</div><div><br /></div><h4>Interpretation</h4><div>There is clear evidence of Human activity around the island for 700 years.</div><div>It goes beyond the singapore rive and extends to kallang river.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, we keep looking at singapore river where singapore have many other rivers where people are living.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Was there activity on this island? Are these stories about johor related to singapore's past?"</div><div><br /></div><div>Should we focus on rivers instead? Homes are found along rivers so should we be tracking activities next to rivers?</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps the problem is with us who references places that doesnt make sense.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><br /><br />
