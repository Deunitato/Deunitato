<h2>Possible questions AY19/20</h2>The following is research done by me in lieu of the final examination of the module GES1011.<br />Please do not copy as you might be caught in plagiarism and it is unfair for me who did all the research only to be stolen by jerks<br /><h3><b>1. Race and Heritage</b></h3><br /><b>Heritage</b><br /><br />A country's heritage is all the qualities, traditions, or features of life there that have continued over many years and have been passed on from one generation to another.<br /><br /><b>Culture</b><br /><br />the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society.<br /><br /><b>What is singapore's culture?</b><br /><br /><br />- Singlish?<br /><br />- Mix identity<br /><br />- A mixture of different cultures<br /><br />- Culture borrowing from over the world<br /><br />- Food<br /><br /><br /><b>Race</b><br /><br /><br />A race is a grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society.<br /><br /><br />Lecture:<br />The word race shift from a general term to something that distinguish people. Race is used to describe the potential to progress.<br /><br /><b>Why is race a factor?</b><br /><br />Race is used to define a person, you can see the term race when filling up forms and applying for any jobs.<br /><br /><b>Why is the need to know the race important?</b><br /><br />Isn't human race one race, why is there a further classification of the different types or races in the world.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>"Is race a continuing relevance today?"</b><br /><br />- CMIO model (Chinese Malay Indian and other) Classification<br /><br />- Is there a need since there are more interracial marriages and immigration leading to a more diverse singapore. =&gt; NUS lecturer<br /><br />- Discarding te model runs the risk of impinging on minorities rights =&gt; Ng Chee Meng, Acting minister for education (Schools)<br /><br />Acting minister argued that blurring this segregation will caused minority races to be unrepresented in their interest.<br />This will cause an unfair designation of inclusive politics<br />But race is the reason that is used to justify acts of colonialism that are barbaric, slavery and genocide. also social inequality<br /><br />- Japanese invasion of singapore - Sook ching massacre<br /><br />To the japanese, we might just seem like pest that needs cleansing, even thou we are humans, we do not see the other race as the same species.<br />Just like how we see ants as pests and we seek to eliminate them, we do not feel that we are being evil but we felt that we are in the right for ridding this world from harmful diseases and pests. Perhaps that's what the Japanese felt when they encounter a bunch of people that called themselves chinese.<br /><br /><br />- The human races were invented by anthropologists like Johann Friedrich Blumenbach back in the eighteenth century in an attempt to categorise new groups of people being encountered and exploited as part of an ever expanding European colonialism.<br /><br />Right from the beginning, the reason for the invention of race is used to segregate people and is still being used until today, The invention of race can be seen as part of the decolonisation process that will never be removed. Since race is used to identify the different people the european manage to colonise, why is it still in place here knowing that we have already break free from our colonial powers.<br /><br /><br /><b>Relic of colonial past (Singapore)</b><br /><br />- Singaporeans have been classified by race ever since the first census in 1824<br /><br />&nbsp;Singaporean felt different to immigrants from similar ethnic backgrounds<br />&nbsp;Some singaporeans felt that is dehumanising to be classified under others because they are a minority<br />&nbsp;Sociologist felt that CMIO model is constrained as it pigeonholes people and creates racial stereotypes<br />The idea of racial segregation often is reminded to us through these subtle things<br /><br /><br />- CMIO model is used to assign residential district to respective ethnic groups and splitting labour along ethnic lines<br /><br /><b>&nbsp; Decolonisation process&nbsp;</b><br />WHy do we still need to keep this model now that we are no longer part of the british colony<br />Arent we jsut singaporean race?<br />Dr nazry Bahrawi: (NUS Humanities Lecturer)<br /><br />Removing it does not necessarily mean that race is no longer important, nor make minority groups anxious, he stresses. That is, if Singapore is "serious about preserving diversity in all its manifestations and uphold the importance of equal cultures".<br /><br /><b>What is the Difference between Race and Ethnicity?</b><br /><br /><br />Race is associated with biology, whereas ethnicity is associated with culture.<br /><br /><br /><b>Ethnology&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Interpret how different human beings are distinct with each other<br /><div><div><br /></div><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Forum Post by me:</span></div><div><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div>I felt that what Prof. Kevin brought up today during the discussion regarding the types of people visiting the different historical museums was quite eye-opening.&nbsp; It is funny how we fail to see all these obvious facts when it is clearly right in front of us.<br /><br />Prof Kevin pointed out the obvious fact that only the people would only go to the museum that talks about their race. The segregation of museums based on race was so obvious yet without Prof pointing it out, we would not have even noticed it.<br /><br />That makes me think about how in Singapore, even thou we claim to be a multiracial and multicultural society, why do we still segregate our schools, places to live and names of locations base on race.<br /><br />For example, why does the location "little India" even exist, the same for places such as "Chinatown". Aren't we being racist here by segregating the different races by the names of the location? And yet we claim to be multicultural.<br /><br />If Singapore is a country that strives to seek racial harmony among the people then why do schools where only children of one type of race are emitted still exist?<br /><br />Is the so called multicultural Singapore just a facade?<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><br /></div><div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 10px;">My rebuttal against the person who disagrees:<br /><br />To be fair, I felt that it is somewhat racist due to the fact that you are segregating all the different races based on location. The idea of segregation by race is already racist considering that the country promotes racial harmony. The problem is not just the name but the fact that you are separating the cultures of different races into different parts of Singapore under the guise of "racial harmony". If the separation of different races is as what you say, "how we celebrate our various races in Singapore", then might as well split this country's land into the number of races that exist and say we celebrating the different races in Singapore by classifying it. I understand that your point is that the existence of these ethnic hubs is to cater to the needs of the different communities, but isn't that worsening the segregation of different races. By creating these locations to support the "different lifestyle depending on our ethnicity", aren't we further separating ourselves from other races because we believe that "we need these special places for our type of people because other races cannot understand our lifestyle"?</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;open sans&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;open sans&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">However, it does serve its purpose in teaching others about the different cultures in Singapore but let's be honest, it is highly unlikely for Chinese Singaporeans to go into little India willingly just to find out about the India culture with the motive for understanding other race's culture.. vice versa for any other race.&nbsp;</span></span></div></div><h3><b>2. Decolonisation based on singapore's experience and suitability</b></h3><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">=Not planning=</span><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><b>3.

This allow the diplomatic ties between singapore and Japan to strengthen and help in singapore's economy.<br /><br />People with a lot of power would always behave very brutal and will always be the oppressor<br />=&gt; stanford prison experiment<br /><h3><b>6. Me and knowledge&nbsp;</b></h3>Question Type: Personal reflection<br />Based on:<br />- is reading art, science?<br />- Reflection on experience given<br />- Intersect of arts and science<br />- Give examples<br />- Forced to do cross modules<br />- Is there a value<br />- Is it worth for our home faculty<br /><br /><b>Is art, science?</b><br />Both science and arts derived from creativity and intelligence and the curious minds of humans. Fundamentally they are the same but science focus more on the logical concepts in terms of functionality while arts is focus more towards the outlook and the creativity in concepts.<br />Science can be used to derive engineering concepts like how things works and how to solve problems, something that art cannot do. However, art can be used to design solutions to solve these problems that are being logically conceptualise by science.<br /><br /><b>Intersections between arts and science</b><br />Leonardo da vinci is a genius in both the arts and science. He excelled in the creation of art and at the creation of great inventions through the use of art.<br />To be able to create art to depict the world around us we need to understand it first and that is the use of science. For example, I like to draw humans a lot but in order to draw accurately, I must know how the human body look like and to be able to understand the structural movements of each body part, how it position and where the locations of each joints should be. That requires science. To create art, we need science to understand it first.<br />Another example is engineering.<br />To engineer is to solve a problem given to us.<br />We need science to find a solution and understand what the problem is asking to solve. Only after understanding that we can find and design a solution to the problem and that is through art.<br /><br /><b>Reflection on Ges1011</b><br />I enjoy ges because it gave me a deep insight about things that are not normally taught to us and at the same times encourages us to remember that knowledge is not as it seems to be. The mod also allow us to critically think and process information that were presented to us when we were children and to think about how our society runs rather than just accept everything that is given to us at face value. Knowledge in the end is just the opinions of others that have not been proven false and they will remain true until proven false.<br />We need to remember not to take everything provided at face value and learn to understand the purpose, the meaning and the reason why everything is done and to question whether it is still relevant in our lives.<br /><br /><b>Why cross modules?</b><br />- Gain insights, broaden perspective<br />- To gain skills that our normal modules cannot do<br />e.g in computer science we are to solve problems but for courses like humanities, we are to pick up critical thinking skills which is not prominent in our main course<br />- To have experience in order to critical think about other situations<br />- To think deeply, ask critical question, logical inferences and debate issues related to diverse and changing cultural landscape<br />- To be able to debate issues, we have to have an insight of what is going on before even giving our opinion as one is not qualified to talk about a topic unless they know something about it. The cross modules help us to understand these topics that will not be taught in our home faculty so that when we go out in the working world we have a general view of what is going on rather than being in a bubble of our own specialisation.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Value</b><br />- Skill sets<br />- insights/basic understanding<br />- Work place<br />- Debates<br />- Critical thinking<br />- Thought processes<br /><br /><b>Worth to home faculty:</b><br />By learning modules that are not related to our home faculty, we are able to gain outside insights from other courses and this can be used to apply to in our own home faculty, Instead of having a bubbled thought where everything we know is related to our own faculty, we are able to think about the other disciplines when facing with problems with our home faculties.<br />e.g My home faculty is computer science and many of our modules revolves around solving problems from real life situation using computer programming. Having a brief insights from these cross module allow to have a brief idea on what the problems are talking about and give us ideas on how to solve these problems. Without understanding what these problems are talking about, we might as well not understand what the question is talking about.<br /><br /><b>Truth about knowledge and information</b><br />These knowledge that are being taught to us is nothing but stories and opinions that come from another. How these stories is being taught to us and the teacher of this stories determined what we think about our current situation and the truth about these facts that is presented to us. All stories have a degree of facts in them but it might have been slowly changed as it spread from mouth to mouth and change due to strong opinions or motives of their listeners. Therefore it is hard to find out the true facts that actually took place in the past and it is up to us to determine which of the stories that are being told to us is facts and not strong opinions and misinterpretation.<br /><br />
