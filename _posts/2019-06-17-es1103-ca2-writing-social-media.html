According to Matsa and Shearer (2018), about 68 per cent of Americans receive news on social media. However, it is these social media that led to the spread of false information which in turn impacted the people in the US well-being negatively by preventing the spread of authentic news. According to Fox (2018), it is found that false news was 70 per cent more likely to be shared compared to credible news. The spread of false news regarding vaccines would give many parents misconception about vaccines which would prevent children from getting vaccinated properly against VPD. Their children are then more vulnerable to these diseases which could have been easily prevented using vaccines, affecting the health of themselves and the people around them by allowing the spread of these diseases. This essay will describe the negative impacts of the spread of misinformation using social media on the wellbeing of the people of the US, discuss a current solution and suggest an improvement to the current solution.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 200%;">The spread of false news through social media led to the misconception of vaccines which in turn discourage parents from vaccination of their children leading to the spread of VPD, affecting children in the US health. This is eminent in the case of anti-vaccinators in the US whereby social media is used to spread untrue news about vaccination. According to Shelby (2017), due to the lack of evidence to support the claims of danger due to vaccination, anti-vaccine activist depends on the spread of false information on vaccines through the use of social media using fabricated stories and photographs taken from unrelated sources. The actions of these activists led to an increase in vaccine refusal and delayed vaccine schedules. According to a 2009 National Immunization survey in the US as quoted by Shelby (2017), among parents of children age 24 to 35 months, 25.8 per cent admitted to delaying vaccines and 8.2 per cent refused the vaccine. Due to the refusal of vaccination, the spread&nbsp;of deadly diseases which could have been prevented by vaccination increased. According to MacDonald (2015), there were many recent outbreaks of VPD (Vaccine-preventable diseases) due to under-vaccinated or non-vaccinated communities. MacDonald (2015) also found that parents in the US that had delayed or refused vaccines are more likely to have researched about vaccines through social media which is prominent in incorrect information rather than approaching healthcare providers and authorities. According to Brunson (2013), parents in the US rely on the internet to retrieve information and advice pertaining to vaccines. The spread of misleading information through social media convinced many to stop allowing their children to received vaccination thus leading to the problem of repeated increase in VPD which could have been stopped if parents had received authentic information.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 200%;">VPD outbreaks could be easily prevented but due to the spread of false information on social media, many people are still suffering from VPD. According to Dube, Laberge and Guay (2013), pertussis, a type of contagious VPD which affects the respiratory system, could have been prevented. However, due to the increasing controversies spread across social media regarding the safety of the vaccines posted by anti-vaccination activist, the uptake for pertussis vaccination plans declined. (2013). The convenience of social media allows the anti-vaccination activist to easily spread false information pertaining to their cause, convincing many parents to not vaccinate their children. According to&nbsp;Salathe and Khandelwal (2011), social media containing similar opinion towards vaccination would lead to an increase in the probability of large outbreaks of diseases. Salathe and Khandelwal (2011) added that there is growing evidence from other studies that show that due to the serious social clustering of exemption of vaccination, there is an increasing risk of VPD outbreaks. Brunson (2013) also agrees that rather than rejecting vaccination decisions independently, they are more likely to follow the decisions made by their social networks. This highlights how dangerous the spread of misleading information in social media about vaccines as it could easily dissuade parents from vaccination.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 200%;">According to Vanderslott and Roser (2015), vaccines have greatly decreased the pervasiveness of diseases however, many people do not realise the importance of vaccination on a global scale. Vanderslott and Roser (2015) further stated that vaccines were able to eradicate certain VPD such as smallpox in 1980 which previously had killed a hundred thousand people every year. However, the spread of misleading information on social media will prevent further eradication of other VPD such as polio that is close to being eradicated due to the spread of false information regarding vaccination. According to WHO as stated by Mundasad (2018), there is a 30 per cent rise of measles cases in 2017 in comparison to 2016. Mundasad (2018) further stated that the rise of fake news about vaccines which supposedly be able to prevent measles is behind the rise of the cases. Overall, the rise of VPD affecting the health of the people is caused by the rise and spread of false information through social media in the personal networks of parents leading to the decline in vaccination of their children, vaccination which would have prevented the spread of VPD and defend the health of the children, the parents and the people around them.<o:p></o:p></span></div></div><br /><br /><br />
