Recap:<br />- How old is singapore? -&gt; It depends :)<br />- Why did we not question our geological context?<br />-&gt; It has continuously and even right now experience changes<br />-&gt; Island in the regio have disappear in the last 150 - 200 years<br />Raffles came around this times, but how come we didnt take note of this instead?<br />- Tambora quake<br />- Krakatoa quake<br />- Geological formation can appear and disappear and singapore is not immune to this.<br /><br /><h3>Human Unfolding</h3><div>When these humans left africa around 100-200000 years ago.. there were hunter gatherers with stone tools.</div><div>We discover fire (400000 years ago) but were not agriculturalist until 12000 years ago</div><div>The negritos are the first people around asia, now they live around philipines and indonesia.</div><div>Dna evidence links them to people groups like south indians, malaesians, papuans.</div><div>But theres no evidence of their presence but they are probably the first human beings in this neighbouhood</div><br />But theres a later, a larger scale significant migration of people groups..<br />This is linguistic evidence.<br /><br />The malay language can be traced back to a group called malayanpolenesian.<br /><br /><h4>Austronesian dispersal</h4><div>Is different from the negritos arrival that came from a different time period.</div><div>This is consider one of the greatest dispersal on record since Africa.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Settle</div><div>- Group</div><div>- Political centralisation, exchange and trade network,</div><div><br /></div><div>Funan is the earliest pre figuring of singapore.</div><div><br /></div><div>Contact and movement was not just about trade, the notion of 'transshipment'</div><div>This also brought religion such as buddism.</div><div>Buddism is the first religion to show that it moves from being an pioneer in agricultural to a promoter of commerce.</div><div><br /></div><div>Buddhism's emphasis on accumulation of wealth made it popular among traders.&nbsp;</div><div>- Srivijaya existence as a trade port in 4th century</div><div>It might be another prefiguring of singapore.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, there is no trace of human activity in singapore.</div><div><br /></div><div>The very first evidence of life, the singapore stone. However, we still cannot decipher it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Prequel to tutorial 1:</div><div>Imagine yourself on a sea vessel</div><div>Remind yourself of the singapore stone's orginal location</div><div>Would you have notice it?</div><div>-&gt; No, i would have been a coolie and too tired to do anything</div><div><br /></div><div>Everything is merely just giving an educated guess.</div><div>The lack of information marks much of human existence.</div><div>We need to be comfortable with large amount of ambiguity and uncertainty.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Human activity may stretch beyong 700 years and the world is connected by trade and religion and language<br />These connection is called sil roads<br /><br /><b>"Is this past, particularly pre-1800,part of singapore's or part of singapura's story?"</b><br /><b><br /></b>Today we celebrate 700 years but how we know that we are not stealing a memory and calling it ours.<br />Is there anyone in this place, who is connected to everything tthat happen 700 years ago?<br />-&gt; Why are we calling it&nbsp; ours just because we came after it<br />Cultural theft<br /><br />Theres a difference in saying there is a history of this island having human activity and a difference between in saying that singapore have a 700 year history.<br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div>
