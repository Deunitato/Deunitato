(2018) Weaponized health communication: Twitter bots and russion trolls amplify the vaccine debate. AM J Public Health.</span><br /><br />Proposed:<br />To start education about vaccines when they are small, and warn children about the ill effects of false information. Education should start when young, teaching them how the vaccine works and the effects of having vaccines such that future generation will understand it better. Its a long term solution compared to the current solution of changing the information. This prepares children in the future so they will be better informed and aware of false information in the future.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This essay examined the impact of the spread of false news regarding vaccines through social media in the US, affecting both parent and children alike. Due to the fact that more than half of Americans received news on social media (Matsa and Shearer, 2018) with false news being 70 per cent more likely to be shared in comparison to authentic news, the spread of false information about vaccines lead many parents to have a misconception regarding vaccines and this led to the prevention of children being properly vaccinated against VPD (Fox,2018). Although there are healthcare providers and authorities that would provide authentic information about vaccines, research shows that the population are more likely to rely on the internet or their social network to attain information (Brunson,2013). However, MacDonald (2015) found that information researched dealing with vaccines through social media are prominent in incorrect information which led many, in the US, to believe in the incorrect information pertaining to vaccines.
