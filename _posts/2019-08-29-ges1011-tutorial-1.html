1. Marwick says that we should not use <span style="background-color: yellow;">history and past as synonyms.</span><br /><br />Past is not history.<br />The past occurred previously and now we are occuring in the history.<br />These are traces of the past.<br /><br />During lecture, we discuss about the trace of singapore, the singapore stone.<br />All the traces we gather are in the past but their are in the present.<br />Historians produce stories based on these traces<br /><br />In LSL Reading, there was a difference in <span style="background-color: yellow;">interpretation</span> of two people on the origin of singapore. Both have a different interpretation even thou they both interpreted from the same source or trace.<br /><br />2. History is a form of knowledge<br />By starting with a trace it elevates with knowledges.<br />By interpreting the trace, persuade the relevant society,<br />We are here to create knowledge.<br />Your interpretation is an expression of our subjectivity that so happens to persuade the relevant society.<br />All knowledge is human except AI,,,,<br /><br />Tutorial question:<br />What kind of knowledge work are we doing in our faculty.<br /><br /><br /><br />
