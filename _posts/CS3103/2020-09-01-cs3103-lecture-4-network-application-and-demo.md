# Network application
- Client to server
- Peer to peer

#### Client server architecture
Properties of server:
- Always on host
- Uses ephemeral ports
- Uses perm IP address
- init communication
- Waits to be contacted

#### P2P
- No always on server
- Arbituary end systems directly communication and serve each other
	- Each host runs both server and client processes


> Question: What is the advantage of P2P
>
> - Everything is client and everything is server


> Question: How does host find the ip address of each other?
>
> - Easy to scale


#### Socket
