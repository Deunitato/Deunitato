# Link state routing
Each router in the network knows the link state so that they can plan the appropriate path
- Distance vector: Router knows only cost to each destination
- Link state: Router knows the entire network topologu
	- Computes shortest path by itself
    - Independent computation of routes

#### Forming shortest path tree for router A in a graph (Dik Algo)

THe cost can be anything depending on the protcol (like latency)

Reading the table:

The open shortest path first protocol is an intradomain routing protocol based on link state routing. Its domain is also an Autonomous system

Key elements:
- Topology dissemination
- Usses link state routing to compute shortest routes

- Open pub available
- Uses link state algo
	- LSA dissemination
    - Topology map at each node
    - route computation using dikjstra algo
- LSA flood throughout the entire AS
	- Does not use any transport layer
    - Directly over IP (Not UDP OR TCP)

Area in autonomus system
 ![CS3103-8-5.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-5.PNG)

- Within an OSPF area, all router maintain the same topoly database. They have no knowledge of netowrk topolgies outside the area
- There is always one router connected to the outside
- There is two types of router
	- Area border router: Lets network knows about the outside
    - Backbone router
    - AS boundary router: Carry infopmation of the network and send outside

Issues in building the routing table
- Determine router local env
	- Neightbour
    - Links
    - Cost of links
- To exchange infomation with the rest of the router to maintain identical database
	- Sent to all router in the area
    - List of network links and their associated cost

For every netowrk interfacce a router has, Hello messages are generated:
 - router ip address for that interface
 - Hello interval
 - Subnmetmask
 - List of neighbour whose hello the sender has already heard


If there is no hello for 40 sec, the link is considered to be broken

![CS3103-8-12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-12.png)


- IP5: Hello I am ip5, i dont know anyone
- IP3: Hello I am IP3, i dont know anyone
- IP4: Hello I am IP4, i dont know anyone
- IP2: Hello I am IP2, I only know where R2 is

> Link state advertisement (LSA): Each entity in an area distributes infomation about its llocal env in these packets

Sent only:
- Router discover neighboiur new
- Link to a neighbour down
- Cost of link change
- Basic refresh backets are sent every 30 mins

> Sent using reliable flooding to syncrhonise

Every node will get to know the LSA of other nodes

- Recieving the LSA, the router will update its table
- If suppose new node is joining: 
	- New router says hello to its neighbours
    - The subsequent will sent hello and spread to all its router in its table and continous


- Every router in an area recieves the LSA generated by other routers in an area and builds the database of LSA that descirbes the topolgy of the area
- The data base of LSA maintained by all routers in an area are identical
- Each router then constructs the shortest oath with itself as the root and using the metric as the cost to build its routing table

> - UG: Indirect

# Types of Links for OSPF
- Point to point
- Transient
- Stub
- Virtual

## Point to point

![CS3103-8-7.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-7.PNG)


- Connect router direct (The two router must be connected to each other)
- Can be backbone
- Can be for any area

Any arisement come to the network or from, it is applicable for both router


## Transient

![CS3103-8-8.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-8.PNG)


- Network have multiple router
- Packet enter and leave through any rotuer

### Designated Router (DR)
Our network sending infomation to the router but the subnet cannot speak for itself. For a broadcast domain with N router, its LSA Message complexity could be O(n^2)

- Designated router and backup router are elected to represent the subnet and broadcast subnet info (Using HEllo protocol)
- All advisement/info will be done by designation router
- ANy router that find changes, will communicate to DR
- DR will broadcast to everyone
- Backup will take over if the DR is not operating
- Each router will only have DR and BDR as neighbour


![CS3103-8-9.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-9.PNG)

## Stub

![CS3103-8-10.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-10.PNG)

- Network connected to only one router
- Packets enter and leave throguh the same router
- R1 Becomes the DR for N1

## Virtual link
- Possibly that one of the links go down.. admin can configure another link 

![CS3103-8-11.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-11.PNG)

# OPSP Packets
- Hello
- Database description
- Link state request
- Link state advertisment: Sending link state to the router
	- Router link
    - Network link
    - Summary link to network
    - Summary link to AS boundary router
    - Extrernal link
- Link state acknowledgement

> Hello messages and LSA are encapsulated in OSPF packets for transmission

![CS3103-8-15.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-15.PNG)


# Database synchronisation
- LSA Database initalisation when a new router is added to the segment
	- DR send summary of its database of LSA to the new router - database descp pckts
    - New router responds with a list of LSA that it does not have or that are outdated: Link state request pcks
    - DR forwards the full LSA in the lsit to the new router: Link state update or advertisement pckts
    

Router infomation maintained at Router
- Router maintains much more infomation than a host system

![CS3103-8-16.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3103-8-16.PNG)


- Some sub subnet destination network
- Observe that the network mask is stored as part of the infomation

> AD: Defines which protocol has a higher priority for portocol, this is to choose whether to use OSPF or RIP protocl
