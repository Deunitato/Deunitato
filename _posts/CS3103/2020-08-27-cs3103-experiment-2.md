# Korusans
- Router is a layer 3 switch
## DHCP

> Note how many times the srever sends a broadcast

## NAT
- A table in the router 
- MAPS the IP address from outside to the client

> See Different networks in FORSUANS

## VLAN

Drawback with hierechally:
- Lack of traffic isolation: Broadcast traffic must traverse its own instituitional network. This also might be a security flaw since the packet have to go through the entire networks to reach the top hierachy
- Inefficient use of switches: A single switch will not be able to provide traffic isolation. If assign a switch to a small group of people e.g 10, we have to waste a **96** port switch
- Managing users: Can move within groups easier.

Switch just have to supports VLAN.
- Host within VLAN communicate with each other as if its connected through a switch
- In a port base vlan, the host are divided to groups
- when moving to another group, network manager just need to reconfigure the vlan software so that the port that person is connected to will be associated with the other VLAN
- Table of port to VLAN is maintain within the switch
- Switch hardware only delievers frame to the same vlan

New difficulty:
- how does traffic from one vlan to another
	- Configure a router with the VLAN connected to the router and just configure that port too belong to both groups
    > The datagram would go first go to VLAN to reach router before being forwarded by the router to the other VLAN

Another scalable approach is to interconnect vlan switches with **VLAN trunking**. 
- A special port on each switch is configure as a trunk port to interconnect to the VLAN switches
- Trunk port belongs to all vlans
- Frames Sents to any vlan will be fowarded to the other VLAN through the trunk link.

> how do we know which vlan is the packet suppose to be
> - Extended ethernet frame format contains a 4 bit vlan tag in the header that carries the identify of the vlan to which the vlan belongs

Connecting two routers from two differnet location:

#### TPID field (VLAN TAG)
- Tag protocol id 
- Tag control info


# FORUSANS

## DHCP
Can be same networks or differnet
### Same networks
![CS3230-lab-2-1.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3230-lab-2-1.PNG)

- DHCP issues a passive open command on UDP port 67 and waits for client
- Booted client issues an active open command. Message is encapsulated in UDP user datagram, which in turn encapsulated in IP datagram
	- Client use all 0 as source
    - All 1 as dest
- Serverr response with either broadcast or unicast message using UDP source port 67 with destination port 68

### Different networks
![CS3230-lab-2-2.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3230-lab-2-2.PNG)


- Broadcast to a relay agent which can be a router or host
= Relay agents knows the unicast add of a DHCP server and listens for broadcast messageat port 67
- When recieve, it encapsulate the message in unicast datagrams and sends the request to the DHCP server
- The rest is the same

> the reason why we use a standard port 68 because of demultiplexing issues

#### Error control
- Checksum: UDP uses this 
- Retransmission policy: Retransmit if the timers runs out

## Configuration
DHCP can be devsied to provide static allocation or dynamic address allocation

### Static
- DHCP server has a database that statiscally binds physical address to IPaddress.
- Deprecated protocol BOOTP

### Dynamic
- DHCP has second database with pool of ipaddress
- DHCP server provides requesting clients with ip addressing with its pool
	- Check static
    - Not exisst: Select and assign
    - add entry
- This is temporary with a lease which is a time out
- can renew the lease

### Transistion states
- DHCP client acts as a state machine that performs transmission from one state to another depending on the message it recieves.

Option:
![CS3230-lab-2-3.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/img/CS3230-lab-2-3.PNG)
#### Init state
DHCPDiscover is broadcast by client
#### Selecting state
- Server response with DHCPOFFER
- Server locks 
- Client recieve offer and choose
- Client sents the DHCPRequest
- If client never recieve anything (DHCPDISCOVER), it will send DHCPDICOVER 4 more time
#### Request State
- Client remains in requesting state until receiving a DHCPACK message from the server
- After receipt of DHCPACK, the client goes from BOUND state
#### Renewing state
- Client wait in this state until
	- Recieve DHCPACK from server: Renew 
    - Doesnt receives ack and 87.5 time run out: Go back rebind state

#### Rebind state
- Client remain in this state until:
	- Client recieves DHCPNACK: Init state
    - Lease expires: Init state
    - Recieve DHCPACK: Bound state and resets the timer
    
### Other issues
#### Early release
- Client might release the time before it expires
- Client send DHCPRELEASE message to server
- Server release the ip and can assign to another client

#### Timer
- Timer percentage stage changes:
	- Renewal
    - Rebinding
    - Expiration
- Server can specify the default value
