# Forusans DNS

## Name space
A name space that maps each address to an uniqye name can be organised flat or hierarchical.

### Flat Name
In a flat name space, a name is assigned to an address. A name in this space is a sequence of characters without structure. The names may or may not have a common that is cannot be used in large systerm such as the internet because it must be centrally controlled to avoid ambiguitive and duplication.

### Hierarchical Name space
In a hierarchicaly name space, each name is made of several parts. 

1) Nature of the organisation
2) Name of organisation
3) Define departments in the organisation
etc.

- Manager does not need to worry that the prefix chosen for a host is taken

## Label
- Each node in a name tree has a label:
	- A string with max 63 chara
    - ROot label is  annull string
    - DNS requires children of a node have a different label whcih guaranteese the uniquesness of the domain names
    
## Domain
### Fully qualified domain name
- Label terminated by null string
- a domain name that contains the full name of the host
- Contain all labels from most specific to the most general
- Label ends with dot (.)

### Partially qualified domain name 
- Label not terminated by null string
- Starts from node buyt does not reach a root
- Used when the name to be resolved belongs to the same site as the client
- Resolver can supply the missing part called suffix to create FQDN.
