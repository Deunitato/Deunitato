## Link state routing
- different from distance vector routing
- Each node in the domain has the entire topo of the domain: the list of nodes and links, how they are connected including the type, cost and condition. 
- Uses dijsksta algo

- Any changes the topolgy must be updated in each nodes
- Link state knowledge: Each node knows the state of each node

## Build routing

Link state routing:
1. Creation of the states of links by each node: LSP
2. Dissemination of LSP to every other router called flooding in an efficient reliable way
3. Formation of a shortest path tree for each node
4. Calculation of a router table based on the shortest path tree.


### Creation of Link state packet (LSP)
LSP can carry a large amount of infoamtion. 
- Assume it carries a min amount of data: 
	- Node identity: Need for topo
    - The list of links: Need for topo
    - Sequence number: Flooding and differentiate new LSP from old
    - Age: Prevent old LSP
Generated on:
	- Change in top
    - Periodic: Ensure that old info is removed

### Flooding
After a node prepare LSP, it must flood the network
1. The creating node send copy of LSP out of each interface
2. The node that recieves lsp compare it with the copy it might have, it keeps the newer one whilst discarding the old one and send a copy in its interface to other nodes

> Dikstra: Greedy algo that picks the shortest path each time

Routing table: each router stores the number of hops needed to destiantion and the name of the enxt router it have to hop to


### OSPF
The Open shortest Path first protocol: AN intradomain routing protocol based on link state routing, It is autonoummous

Areas: 
- All networks inside the area must be connected
- Areas inside must flood the area with routing info
- Special router: 
	- Area border router: Summaries the info about the area and send to other area
	- Backbone: All of the areas inside the autonomous systerm mus be connect to this
- Not all router is connected to each other


> Backbone router can also be area border router

There can be a virtual link between router to ensure the connectivity between backbone and primary area (In case the abckbone link drops)


#### Metric
The OSPF protocol allows adminstrator to assign a cost call metrix to each route. 

Metric:
- Minimum delay
- Max throughtput

> Router can have multiple routing tables depending on the metric


### Types of links
- Point to point: Router to router
- Transient: Network with several router attached
- Stub: Network that is connected to only one router
- Virtual: Imaginary connection to a router or node
