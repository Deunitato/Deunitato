A: The social cultural Significance of milk tea?<br /><br />1. Milk tea craze from taiwan<br />A big part of our society<br /><br />2. Sugar level in milk tea<br />- Debate over taking different sugar levels in milk tea<br />- Taking 100 percent is<br />- Did not finish because did not have enough things to talk about<br /><br />B: Sandals - general shoes<br />1.<br />Sandals are convenient and are many types.<br />It is a very smooth surface,<br />Pic: Design is bad, cannot adjust the size of sandals<br />The feet might outgrow the sandals.<br />Strings connecting to shoes might be prone to wear and tear.<br />2.<br />- Like this sandals<br />- design:<br />Does not have the typical sandals design<br />Made of leather<br />- Uses:<br />More secure<br />Casual and cooling<br />-Everyday:<br />Everyone would love to wear sandals due to hot weather in singapore<br />Try not to wear sandals during certain events to appear too casuals.<br /><br />C: Marijuana - legalize not legal lies<br />1.<br />Personal experience of marijuana<br />A debate if it should be legal<br />There are states that use marijuana for legal<br />Highly toxic substance<br />Some report says that its less harmful compared to cigerattes<br />It can be both drugs and cigerattes<br />There is a legal barrier that keeps it from abusing the drugs.<br />Personally dont think that all country is going to legalised it as countries such as singapore is quite conservative.<br />People tried to follow the rules made.<br /><br />2.<br />Legalising in singapore<br />Never smoke in singapore but will smoke in this presentation<br />Health benefits:<br />- Alcohol<br />- Chronic pains<br /><br />It is not legalised because of its human tendency of addiction<br />e.g addiction to coffee or cigerattes<br />The main concern is the fear of human addiction.<br /><br />In terms of health benefits, marijuana has benefits<br />cough syrups can cause addiction.<br />There are people who sniff glue but it is not ban in singapore as it is easier to control the sale of these items.<br />It is to control the sale of these items because if we legalise, the concern will be black market and things that we cant control like underground sale.<br />Marijuana have a big addiction thus the legalisation will not happen any time soon.<br /><br />D - Nokia recent release of revamp version of its classic 3310 models<br />1.<br />Elder people preferes nokia phones due to its flexibility and durability<br />Nokia did not catch up with the market just like the older search engine<br />Sales continue to detoriate<br />Blackberry has fallen as well<br />Still be like an audience that will purchase these phones<br />For example, games also there are people who wants to play older games even thou they are old<br /><br />2.<br />Admirable business risk<br />There are companies that will get left behind due to the fast development of phones over the last few couple of years<br />It is good for people who just want to keep in touch with the past gen of phone<br />Novelty factor<br />We think of it as a cultural icon, a vintage icon -3310 and it appeals to collectors and hipsters<br />In a sense, the phone is a great buisness idea as it revive an old piece of tech that might capture the essense of how it has been use back then and the fact that it is an old phone means that the production cost is low.<br />good business decision,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
