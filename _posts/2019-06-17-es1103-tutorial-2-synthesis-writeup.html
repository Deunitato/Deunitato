According to DSUK (2012), Phone tracking notifies employers on the whereabouts of their employees, this allows employers to find out where their workers spend time overseas. Employees can conveniently check the whereabouts of their employees through an application without much effort. These tracking applications can provide warnings to their employees if they are doing something dangerous. For example, phone tracking can notify employers if their employees are driving dangerously past the speed limit. Thus provide a warning for their employees. Facial tracking can also prove useful in a business context. According to Shuppe (2018), it is found that Orlando has a local law enforcement agency that made use of facial recognition in order to track the population, especially those on the watch list. This makes tracking the population that is on the watch list convenient.<br /><br />In terms of consumers, phone tracking can be useful when locating other people. DSUK(2012) suggests that&nbsp;consumers can make use of phone tracking technology to locate their friends in crowded areas. Consumers can conveniently make use of a third party application to locate their friends without much effort. Consumers could also make use of this feature in a more serious context. The author also states that the phone tracking system could locate a lost or missing person or child easily. This could aid officials in search of a missing person. The tracking system will allow officials to conveniently view the missing person's previous locations, allowing quicker investigations. Uhrich (2017) also suggested that the tracking system is useful during emergencies as applications such as BlueLight will alert a friend when the user has reached their destination safely. This is useful when the user is stranded due to a fault in their vehicles and require assistance to return home.<br /><br />As stated by Gregory according to Shuppe(2018), tracking is a technology that is predicted to be capable and useful in the near future. Tracking has many advantages in terms of&nbsp;use and convenience in the business and consumer setting.<br /><div><br /></div>
