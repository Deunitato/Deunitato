<h2>Sample Space and Sample Points</h2><h3>Sample Space</h3><div>The set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment is call a sample sspace and it is repreented by the symol s.</div><div><br /></div><div>Observation: An recording of information Numerical or categorical</div><div>e.g Weight (Numerical), gender (categorical)</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="color: #6aa84f;">However, if we divide the weight into categories such that there are 2, bigger than 65 cat and smaller than 65 . In this case, its categorical. We need to look at what information is rpesented to us about a specific variable</span></div><div><span style="color: #6aa84f;"><br /></span></div><div>Statiscal Experiment: Generates a set of data</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>e.g</div><div>1.
